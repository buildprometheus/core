# Build Prometheus: Core

**Breathes air. Shits carbon.**

This is the open-source foundation of Prometheus — a modular, carbon-negative energy system that burns methane in oxygen, captures the CO₂, and runs on solar power. It’s a machine that reverses climate change — and we’re building it in the open.

## What This Is

Prometheus is:

- 🧪 An energy system that runs on sun, water, and air
- 🔥 A combustion cycle with **net-negative emissions**
- ⚙️ Modular and scalable — from container to continent
- 🦄 Open-source — because the planet can’t wait for patents

We:
- Split water into hydrogen and oxygen (electrolysis)
- Create methane (CH₄) through methanation
- Burn it in **pure oxygen** for clean power
- Capture the CO₂ exhaust and send it back to our methanation loop
- Capture CO₂ from the air (DAC)
- Captured CO₂ is separated into pure carbon and O₂ through Molten Carbon Electrolysis (MCE)

The result? Clean electricity. Useful heat. And **solid carbon bricks**.

## Why This Repo

This repo is the canonical home for:

- Feasibility studies
- System diagrams
- Energy and mass flow models
- Process control concepts
- Hardware design files (eventually)
- Engineering challenges & discussion

If it helps us build a Prometheus prototype faster, it belongs here.

## Join the Movement

We're designing in the open, arguing in public, and inviting the world to build with us.
