# Prometheus System Overview

**Prometheus is a modular, carbon-negative energy system.**  
It uses solar energy to split water and capture CO‚ÇÇ from the air ‚Äî then synthesizes methane (CH‚ÇÑ), burns it in pure oxygen, captures the resulting CO‚ÇÇ, and stores it.

We reverse emissions with every cycle.

## üîÅ System Flow

1. **Electrolysis**  
   - Uses solar electricity to split water (H‚ÇÇO) into hydrogen (H‚ÇÇ) and oxygen (O‚ÇÇ)

2. **Direct Air Capture (DAC)**  
   - Pulls carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) from ambient air

3. **Methanation Reactor**  
   - Combines H‚ÇÇ and CO‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CH‚ÇÑ (methane) + H‚ÇÇO  
   - Sabatier reaction:  
     `CO‚ÇÇ + 4H‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CH‚ÇÑ + 2H‚ÇÇO + heat`

4. **Oxy-Combustion Power Cycle**  
   - Burns CH‚ÇÑ in O‚ÇÇ (instead of air)  
   - Produces clean power, CO‚ÇÇ, and water  
   - No nitrogen = pure CO‚ÇÇ exhaust stream  
   - `CH‚ÇÑ + 2O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CO‚ÇÇ + 2H‚ÇÇO + energy`

5. **Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS)**  
   - CO‚ÇÇ is compressed and stored (geologically, or as solid carbon blocks)

## ‚ö° Output

- **Electricity** (dispatchable, solar-backed)
- **Heat** (usable or rejectable)
- **Captured CO‚ÇÇ** (ready for storage or valorization)

## üåç Why It Matters

- Net-negative emissions
- Works **anywhere the sun shines**
- Combines **proven tech** in a novel loop
- Solves energy, climate, and dispatchability in one system

## ü¶Ñ Notes

- Prometheus doesn‚Äôt "offset" carbon ‚Äî it **pulls it from the air and buries it**
- Every hour it runs, the planet gets cleaner
- Designed to be open, modular, and remixable
