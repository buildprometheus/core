# Mission Constitution of Prometheus Org

## Preamble

Prometheus Org exists to accelerate global carbon removal in service of climate stability, intergenerational justice, and planetary resilience. We act not for profit, but for posterity — operating as a distributed, mission-driven engine of coordinated action.

This constitution establishes the foundational rules, values, and structures that will govern our conduct, guide our growth, and protect the mission from co-option, drift, or stagnation.

---

## 1. Mission Statement

Prometheus Org exists to:
- Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at planetary scale.
- Advance technologies and practices that are verifiable, durable, and regenerative.
- Support open knowledge, shared infrastructure, and public-good innovation.
- Operate with transparency, independence, and accountability.

### Non-Negotiable Commitments:
- We do not exist to maximize profit or shareholder value.
- We may monetize carbon (e.g. via verified removal credits or carbon byproducts), but we reject speculative, extractive, or greenwashing-driven credit markets.
- We do not compromise long-term mission integrity for short-term gain.
- We do not operate under centralized, hierarchical, or extractive power structures.

## 2. Legal Structure

- Prometheus Org shall be registered as a **nonprofit** entity in multiple jurisdictions:
  - Australia: Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)
  - United States: 501(c)(3) Public Charity
  - European Union: Stichting or AISBL equivalent

- Each legal entity is a **node** in a global federation, bound by this shared constitution.

- All entities must include:
  - A binding mission clause
  - An asset lock
  - A commitment to dissolve into mission-aligned bodies only

---

## 3. Membership and Participation

- **Members** are contributors aligned with the mission. They do not “own” Prometheus Org but act as stewards.
- Work is organized into autonomous yet interdependent **circles** (working groups).
- A rotating **Guardianship Council** (5–9 members) safeguards mission integrity. It can:
  - Veto mission-violating decisions
  - Trigger constitutional reviews
  - Initiate public audits or dissolution

---

## 4. Governance and Decision-Making

- Prometheus Org uses **consent-based governance** (not majority voting).
- Core decisions must be logged in a transparent decision record.
- There is no CEO or single point of executive control.
- Roles may be distributed, elected, or time-limited — but power remains networked.

---

## 5. Financial Stewardship

- All funding must serve the mission. No dividends, equity payouts, or private enrichment.
- Contributors may be compensated fairly, aligned with nonprofit sector norms.
- Volunteer recognition is encouraged, including:
  - Travel or housing stipends
  - Public acknowledgment
  - Participatory governance

- Prometheus Org may receive funding from:
  - Philanthropic sources
  - Public or multilateral grants
  - Aligned investors (non-extractive, mission-locked)

---

## 6. Technology and IP

- All core R&D is **open source** or **open access** by default.
- IP is stewarded via a **Prometheus Commons Trust** or equivalent.
- Licenses may enforce non-enclosure, replication rights, or ethical usage constraints.

---

## 7. Amendments and Evolution

- Amendments require:
  - 60-day public notice
  - 75% support from active members
  - Alignment with Section 1 (Mission Statement)

- No amendment may delete or undermine the **Non-Negotiable Commitments** without unanimous consent of the Guardianship Council.

---

## 8. Dissolution

In the event of dissolution, all assets must:
- Be transferred to a nonprofit with a directly aligned mission
- Or placed in a public trust for ongoing carbon removal efforts

No assets may be distributed privately or commercially.

---

## 9. Ratification

This constitution is adopted once:
- Ratified by two or more legal nodes
- Endorsed by a quorum of founding contributors
- Published to a public repository (e.g. Git)
